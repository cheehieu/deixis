Utilized ROS to handle an experiment involving the Bandit II robot, marker pointers, SICK-LMS laser range finder, overhead and forward-facing cameras, head tracking, Wiimote controller, OpenCV, ARToolkit+. Ran experiments on 15+ human test subjects.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
